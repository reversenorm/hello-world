# hello-world

Hello, I did coding circa 2006 but have been away from it for a while. In the mean time the internet really grew up and I'm teaching myself GitHub because that seems to be a good industry standard for hosting code. Also I've been doing a lot of hobby science and I want a place to work through some of my simulations.
